          I&apos;m a current student at the University of Illinois
          Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. I&apos;ve always loved
          problem solving and figuring out how things work, and as a result felt
          a natural inclination towards CS. <br />
          <br />
          I enjoy web development as well as backend/fullstack development. The
          topic that first amazed me in CS was the Internet of Things, and how
          devices can connect and communicate with eachother wirelessly, so
          systems programming is something I&apos;ve recently dabbled in through
          classes.
          <br />
          <br />
          In college I&apos;ve been a part of Women in Computer Science as a
          Social Co-Chair for a year, was part of the Hackillinois 2023 staff,
          and am the current Co-Director of Reflections | Projections. Apart
          from that, I love to crochet, puzzle, read books, and go for a run
          outside all while listening to my favorite music! &ensp;
