            I&apos;m a current masters student at University of Illinois
            Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. I&apos;ve always loved
            figuring out how things work on a deeper level, as well as
            understanding about how people can interact with different things
            without even knowing it. <br />
            <br />
            I have the most experience in fullstack development, including
            backend APIs and frontend web applications. I also enjoy learning
            about systems programming and networking at the lower level.
            <br />
            <br />
            In college I&apos;ve been a part of Women in Computer Science, the
            Hackillinois 2023 staff, and was the Co-Director of Reflections |
            Projections. Apart from that, I love to crochet, puzzle, read books,
            and go for a run outside all while listening to my favorite music!
